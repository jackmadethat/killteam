        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Shield World of Vespera marks one of the only navigational points linking the southern Terran sector of the Milky Way with the eastern Kingdom Worlds. Rebel forces and hostile alien armies have thrown the sector into turmoil, and the war threatens to breach Terran space. With a collossal fleet approaching, Vespera's great cannon has been primed and prepares to fire.</p>
        <h3>Premise</h3>
        <p>The firing of the Great Gun is a single-mission campaign suitable as a solo/co-op mission or as a themed PvP match. With each turning point, the killzone changes, creating different conditions of play.</p>
        <p>With the first turning point there is chaos - the gun prepares to fire. Panic has hit the streets, gangs and rioters loot what they can to weather the gun's mighty blast.</p>
        <p>In the second turning point, there is an eerie calm as the firing is imminent. The streets are quiet, the kill teams have a clear window to retrieve intel, secure valuable artifacts, and find safety.</p>
        <p>In the third turning point, the gun fires. The earth-shattering blast shakes the ground, leveling the older, weaker buildings to rubble. The luckier civilians in the area are only deafened, while the rest have their bodies broken by the shockwave.</p>
        <p>In the final turning point, the aftermath of the gun's deliverance, the streets are shrouded smoke, dust and debris. Shaken, the kill teams must exfiltrate with whatever prizes they've secured and prevent any hostiles from escaping with loot of their own.</p>
