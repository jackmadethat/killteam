        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Stranded in the icy, mountainous wastelands of the edgeworld known as Rhyolith, a detachment of Federation scouts must find high ground to light a beacon in the hope of hailing passing mining and transport vessels. Little do they know, Rhyolith isn't as lifeless as they think, and one of their number is infected with a parasite - a parasite that will grow and explode from their body, then consume the group with a ravenous hunger that only the most deadly bioforms of the Swarm can achieve.</p>
