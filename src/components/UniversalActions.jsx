        <p>Actions have effects (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmadethat/killteam/refs/heads/main/src/img/yes.svg" className="svgImg" />) and conditions (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmadethat/killteam/refs/heads/main/src/img/no.svg" className="svgImg" />). <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmadethat/killteam/refs/heads/main/src/img/no.svg" className="svgImg" /> are conditions that must be fulfilled for the operative to perform that action, whilst <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmadethat/killteam/refs/heads/main/src/img/yes.svg" className="svgImg" /> are effects when an operative is performing that action, including any requirements when doing so. There are four different types of actions: universal, unique, mission and free.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Universal actions</b> are the most common actions you will use and can be performed by all operatives unless specified otherwise. The main universal actions can be found below.</li>
            <li><b>Unique actions</b> are rarer actions in your kill team’s rules. Only specified operatives can perform them.</li>
            <li><b>Mission actions</b> are specific to the mission or killzone you are playing. If there are any, they will be in your mission pack, killzone rules or the equipment you’ve selected.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Free actions</b> can only be performed when another rule specifies, and the following rules apply:
                <ul>
                    <li>The conditions of the action must be met.</li>
                    <li>It does not cost the operative any additional AP to perform the action.</li>
                    <li>The operative would still count as performing the action for all other rules purposes. For example, if it performed the action during its activation, it wouldn’t be able to perform it again during that activation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="indentNote"><em>If an operative performs a free action outside of their activation, it does not prevent them from performing that action during their activation, or vice versa.</em></p>
