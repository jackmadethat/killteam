        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Political unrest grips the hiveworld of Oproxis II. A shifting of government is imminent that sees the planet either remaining in the Federation or seceding; either outcome a guarantee of civil war and decades of strife. An elite team of mercenaries is hired to escort a VIP - the sitting Administrator of Oproxis - across a sprawling metropolis to a safehouse, navigating hostile gangs and opportunistic muggers. Little do they know, a large, separatist faction has hired an assassin to eliminate the VIP, and they never miss their mark.</p>
