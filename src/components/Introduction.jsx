      <p><em>Kill Team</em> is a tactical combat miniatures game set in the grim dark future of the 41st Millennium. Two rival teams of highly trained operatives battle and complete objectives to achieve victory. It's a completely separate game from Warhammer 40k, focusing on small-scale battles between individual characters rather than big armies. The tight scale, shorter game length and low number of units makes Kill Team one of the cheapest and most accessible ways to get into the 40k hobby and tabletop wargaming.</p>
      <p>The game is designed for Warhammer 40k miniatures, but teams of other miniatures are fine (referred to as 'proxies') as long as they comply with Kill Team Rules. The beauty of Kill Team is that, due to the small number of miniatures, each can have their own unique character and design.</p>
      <p>While the game is primarily played with 2 players, Co-Op and single player missions are possible, and a great way to learn the ropes before playing against other players.</p>
      <h3>What you'll need to play Kill Team:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A kill team for each player</li>
        <li>A play area (referred to as the 'killzone') of 30" x 22", unless your mission specifies a different size</li>
        <li>A rulebook for reference, mission pack for game-specific details, and rules for each kill team
          <p className="indentNote"><em>Much of the above is freely available online on the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/kill-team/">Warhammer Community website</a> or in the free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamesworkshop.kt3">Kill Team mobile app</a>. The 'Lite Rules' document is a perfect, three-page reference containing enough of the core rules to play a complete game.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>Terrain and equipment markers, either from official Kill Team box sets or improvised from elsewhere (Jenga blocks are a surprisingly effective proxy for terrain)</li>
        <li>A measurement device, such as measuring tape or a ruler</li>
        <li>A way to track score and other data for the duration of the game, such as a notepad</li>
        <li>Around 10 six-sided dice (D6)</li>
        <li>Gameplay tokens
