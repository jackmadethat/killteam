        <h3>Grenade Rules</h3>
        <p>Grenades are a Universal equipment option so any operative can use them (limited by the number that the player selects and availability detailed in your kill team's rules), Utility grenades as an action and Explosive grenades as a ranged weapon. You do not need to nominate which operative is carrying which grenade ahead of time, you only need to track the number of grenades team-wide. The exception to this is operatives with the Grenadier type, which have different grenade rules and limitations.</p>
        <p className="indentNote"><em>As an equipment option, selected grenades, either Utility or Explosive, represent 2 grenades of that type.</em></p>
        <p>Explosive grenades, due to being a ranged weapon, require a <em>valid target</em> to use, while utility grenades can be thrown anywhere within their range.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Grenade Rules</h3>
        <p>The following grenade rules are unofficial and optional.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b><em>Point Targeting</em></b>: All grenades can be thrown at specific locations rather than requiring valid targets.</li>
            <li><b><em>Ricochet</em></b>: Grenades can be thrown at walls to bounce them around corners. Angles must be approximated in a realistic way, bounces are limited to 1 per grenade throw, and the grenade can't travel further than it's maximum range.</li>
            <li><b><em>Breaching</em></b>: Explosive grenades can be thrown at doors (and hatchways, etc) to blow the door out. From that point on, the door is open and can't be closed.</li>
            <li><b><em>Destructive</em></b>: If a Ladder, Light Barricade or Portable Barricade falls under a frag grenade's blast range, it is destroyed and removed from the killzone.</li>
            <li><b><em>Lobbing</em></b>: Grenades can be thrown 50% further than their maximum range (for example, if the grenade has a range of 6" it can be lobbed 9", as 50% of 6 is 3). When lobbing a grenade, nominate the desired location then roll a scatter dice and a d3; the grenade lands at a distance equal to the value of the d3 in inches away from the desired location and in the direction the scatter dice is pointing.</li>
        </ul>

            <p>Scatter dice. If the die lands on the crosshair, the throw is accurate and the grenade lands on target.</p>
