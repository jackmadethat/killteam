          <p>When setting up the battle, after setting up objective markers, number each objective marker 1–3.</p>
          <p>At the start of the Gambit step of each Strategy phase, each player secretly selects one objective marker by putting a number of dice in their hand that matches that marker’s number, then reveal simultaneously:
            <ul>
              <li>If both players selected the same one, that objective marker is inert during this turning point</li>
              <li>If not, the objective marker that neither player selected is inert during this turning point</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 className="opSubHeading" style={{ marginBottom: -10 + 'px' }}>VICTORY POINTS</h3>
          <p>At the end of each turning point after the first, for each objective marker friendly operatives control, you score 1VP. Ignore inert objective markers when determining this.</p>
