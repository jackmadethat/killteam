        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Responding to a mysterious signal in an unexplored region of the galaxy, a deep-space exploration squad discovers a habitable, earth-like world. At the location of the beacon, the team discovers a timeless, arcane labyrinth. The dangers that may lurk within pale in comparison to what treasures it may hold, so the team eagerly delves into it's dusty hallways. Unbeknownst to them, they've crossed the threshold into the sleeping chambers of an ancient, immortal race of warriors - and with the team's response to their signal, the warriors now awaken.</p>
